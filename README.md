## A simple cpp class using nlohmann/json library

It's a little messy but it's one of my first projects, it has many things to improve like error catching.

### How to use it

Use as input in the constructor the ip of the wiz light

Try changing the light color with changeColor() and turn it off or on with toggleState()
